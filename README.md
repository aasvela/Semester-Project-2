# SP2

The project uses bootstrap scss which is added as a folder in the project.
Users must install a sass compiler to compile the scss files into css files, for example Live Sass Compiler

## USE

The project is a auction house for whisky entusiasts. The user can create an account and login to the site.
The user can then create auctions and bid on other auctions. The user can also edit and delete their own auctions.
The user can also see their own profile and see their own auctions and bids.
The stats bar is a collapsable bar that shows the user some information that is relevant for the auctions.

### Auctions

The site uses a tag to filter out the auctions that are relevant for this project. Each auction generated gets a hardcoded "whisky" tag, and only auctions with this tag will be shown on the site.
An auction can not last more than 7 days. Therefore a user will not be able to set an auction to last longer than 7 days.
